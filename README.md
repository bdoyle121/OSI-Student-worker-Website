# OSI-Student-worker-Website

# This website will help Mcshane center staff with task such as speaker set up, room setup with both room pc and hmdi and trouble shooting if there is a problem in the rooms. There will also be a section for the id sanners which are used with CAB, Senior week and Orintation events. As of right now the process for the sanccers are inefficient and time consuming. This website will make it easy for the BM/BA on duty to access the id sanner sit allowing them to focus on other event tasks. 

# There will also be other rescoures for training propouses like commone question over the phone and how to respone.
